		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<div id="challenge">
				<p> This is my first time trying out CSS and it doesn't seem too difficult, just a bit tricky. My biggest challenge with this website is trying to make it look good by having complimentary colors, but I think it needs a font change.</p>
			</div>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<div id="problems">
				<p> Sadly, I couldn't figure out how to change the image very much (on my own, at least). Also I'm not sure how to adjust the border for the image. I'm sure I could fix it with some time, but right now I need to catch up on the work.</p>
			</div>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<div id="results">
				<p> I like how much freedom I have on my website now. I feel like the chains of html have been broken. CSS is so cool. I added this underline and box shadow effect that I really like as well.
