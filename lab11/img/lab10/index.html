		<h1>Lab 10: Styling Text Elements (aka why Sora shouldn't be in Smash Bros)</h1>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>Everybody likes Sora for some reason and it's proably because they grew up with a disney game because the parents went, "Oh haha hey it's mickey mouse and donald" so they bought it for their kid and now their kid has a nostalgic attachment to a game that isn't even GOOD.
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>This character is UGLY and is BASELESS. No one in the right mind likes this charater why don't they add Garfield the cat or Naruto, my favorite orange guys.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Sora got in the game as the last character and now I have depression.</p>
