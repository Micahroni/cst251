		<aside id="sidebar">
			<p>Recently, I purchased a game called, "Tower Unite". It's a social MMO with minigames and other cool stuff. I wasn't sure if I should tell my friends about it, because I might not like the game enough for them to all drop $14 on it. But they did. The game is addicting. Here are some screenshots.</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>Usually when I buy a game, I have the habit of telling all my friends to buy the game (I'm a trendsetter) even though I'm not 100% sure if the game will be fun for more than a couple months or weeks. So this time I just played it for a bit and let my friends decide if they wanted it.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>They eventually got the game, but we coudln't get my friend to stop watching family guy on the in-game computer.</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>We all had a lot of fun and Tower Unite was well-worth the money.</p>
