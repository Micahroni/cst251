		<h2>Summary</h2>
			<p>Today, we made our webpage look awesome by linking a CSS file to the index.html file!</p>
		<h2>Struggles</h2>
			<p>I worked on my own since I didn't get to attend class, and I couldn't figure out how to make a form.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>So far the website looks good and different than all my other pages, however I'm not sure if I'm missing a crucial step because I skipped one.</p>
